            "During my final year internship, I had the opportunity to work on an internal monitoring tool aiming to provide different project management key indicators to multiple types of users. I was in charge of a financial summary and a quality management overview modules, either interfaced with another internal tool or fully independent.",
            "Thanks to the specifications provided, I was able to build these modules from the backend (data structures, services, management...) to the frontend (global interface, UX, web services consumption...).",

            "These modules are now integrated to the global solution and will be soon brought to use by different people."
